abstract = {In multivariate or spatial extremes, inference for max-stable processes observed at a large collection of points is a very challenging problem and current approaches typically rely on less expensive composite likelihoods constructed from small subsets of data. In this work, we explore the limits of modern state-of-the-art computational facilities to perform full likelihood inference and to efficiently evaluate high-order composite likelihoods. With extensive simulations, we assess the loss of information of composite likelihood estimators with respect to a full likelihood approach for some widely used multivariate or spatial extreme models, we discuss how to choose composite likelihood truncation to improve the efficiency, and we also provide recommendations for practitioners. This article has supplementary material online.},

abstract = {Snow depth records from daily measurements at climatological stations were obtained from Environment Canada and were processed and analyzed. It was identified that there are 549 stations, each with at least 20 years of useable annual maximum snow depth data. Both the Gumbel distribution and generalized extreme value distribution were used to fit the annual maximum snow depth, considering several distribution fitting methods. Statistical analysis results indicated that, according to the Akaike information criterion, the Gumbel distribution is preferred for 72 {\%} stations. The estimated return period value of annual maximum snow depth at stations was used to calculate their corresponding ground snow load. The at-site analysis results were used as the basis to spatially interpolate the ground snow loads for locations tabulated in the National Building Code of Canada (NBCC) since a code location and a climatological site are usually not co-located. For the interpolation, the ordinary co-kriging method with elevation as co-variate was used because a cross-validation analysis by using several deterministic and probabilistic spatial interpolation techniques indicated that the ordinary co-kriging method is preferred. A comparison of the newly estimated ground snow loads to those locations tabulated in the 1995 edition and 2010 edition of the NBCC was also presented.},

abstract = {Classical Extreme Value Theory-the asymptotic distributional theory for maxima of independent, identically distributed random variables-may be regarded as roughly half a century old, even though its roots reach further back into mathematical antiquity. During this period of time it has found significant application-exemplified best perhaps by the book Statistics of Extremes by E.J. Gumbel-as well as a rather complete theoretical development. More recently, beginning with the work of G.S. Watson, S.M. Berman, R.M. Loynes, and H. Cramer, there has been a developing interest in the extension of the theory to include, first, dependent sequences and then continuous parameter stationary processes. The early activity proceeded in two directions-the extension of general theory to certain dependent sequences (e.g., Watson and Loynes), and the beginning of a detailed theory for stationary sequences (Berman) and continuous parameter processes (Cramer) in the normal case. In recent years both lines of development have been actively pursued.

@article{Marty2012,
abstract = {Mountain snow cover is an important source of water and essential for winter tourism in Alpine countries. However, large amounts of snow can lead to destructive avalanches, floods, traffic interruptions or even the collapse of buildings. We use annual maximumsnowdepth and snowfall data from 25 stations (between 200 and 2,500m) collected during the last 80 winters (1930/31 to 2009/2010) to highlight temporal trends of annual maximum snow depth and 3-day snowfall sum. The generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution with time as a covariate is used to assess such trends. It allows us in particular to infer how return levels and return periods have been modified during the last 80 years. All the stations, even the highest one, show a decrease in extreme snow depth, which is mainly significant at low altitudes (below 800 m). A negative trend is also observed for extreme snowfalls at lowand high altitudes but the pattern at mid-altitudes (between 800 and 1,500 m) is less clear. The decreasing trend of extremesnowdepth and snowfall at lowaltitudes seems to be mainly caused by a reduction in the magnitude of the extremes rather than the scale (variability) of the extremes. This may be caused by the observed decrease in the snow/rain ratio due to increasing air temperatures. In contrast, the decreasing trend in extreme snow depth above 1,500mis caused by a reduction in the scale (variability) of the extremes and not by a reduction in themagnitude of the extremes. However, the decreasing trends are significant for only about half of the stations and can only be seen as an indication that climate change may be already impacting extreme snow depth and extreme snowfall.},

@article{Gaume2013a,
abstract = {The evaluation of extreme snowfalls is an important challenge for hazard management in mountainous regions. In this paper, the extreme snowfall data acquired from 40 meteorological stations in the French Alps since 1966 are analyzed using spatial extreme statistics. They are then modeled within the formal framework of max-stable processes (MSPs) which are the generalization of the univariate extreme value theory to the spatial multivariate case. The three main MSPs now available are compared using composite likelihood maximization, and the most flexible Brown-Resnick one is retained on the basis of the Takeuchi information criterion, taking into account anisotropy by space transformation. Furthermore, different models with smooth trends (linear and splines) for the spatial evolution of the generalized extreme value (GEV) parameters are tested to allow snowfall maps for different return periods to be produced. After altitudinal correction that separates spatial and orographic effects, the different spatial models are fitted to the data within the max-stable framework, allowing inference of the GEV margins and the extremal dependence simultaneously. Finally, a nested model selection procedure is employed to select the best linear and spline models. Results show that the best linear model produces reasonable quantile maps (assessed by cross-validation using other stations), but it is outperformed by the best spline model which better captures the complex evolution of GEV parameters with space. For a given return period and at fixed elevation of 2000 m, extreme 3 day snowfalls are higher in the NE and SE of the French Alps. Maxima of the location parameter of the GEV margins are located in the north and south, while maxima of the scale parameter are located in the SE which corresponds to the Mediterranean influence that tends to bring more variability. Besides, the dependence of extreme snowfalls is shown to be stronger on the local orientation of the Alps, an important result for meteorological variables confirming previous studies. Computations are performed for different accumulation durations which enable obtaining magnitude-frequency curves and show that the intensity of the extremal directional dependence effect is all the more important when the duration is short. Finally, we show how the fitted model can be used to evaluate joint exceedence probabilities and conditional return level maps, which can be useful for operational risk management.},

abstract = {This paper makes a regional evaluation of trend in yearly maxima of daily rainfall in southern France, both at point and spatial scales on a regular grid of 8 × 8 km2. In order to filter out the high variability of rainfall maxima, the current analysis is based on a non-stationary GEV modeling in which the location parameter is allowed to vary with time. Three non-stationary models are considered for each series of maxima by constraining the location parameter to vary either linearly, linearly after a given date or linearly up to a final date. Statistical criteria are used to compare these models and select the best starting or final point of putative trends. The analysis shows that, at regional scale, the best distribution of maxima involves a linear trend starting in year 1985 and that this trend is significant in half the region, including most of the mountain ranges and part of the Rh{\^{o}}ne valley. Increases in yearly maxima are considerable since they reach up more than 60 mm/day in 20 years, which is more than 40 {\%} of the average maximum in this area.},

abstract = {The annual maximum 3-day snow fall depth H72 is often adopted as an input for avalanche hazard mapping procedure. The quantile of H72 with a reference return period T, in years, is evaluated using standard statistical distributions. The choice of the proper distribution is a key step. This is particularly critical in those sites where short observed series of H72 are available, because the required return periods are in the order of 300 years. Here, the distribution of H72 is investigated for a network of 40 gauging stations in the Alpine part of Lombardia region, in the central Italian Alps, using a data set dating back to 1985. A regional approach based on the index value is developed to estimate the T-years return period quantiles of H72 at each single site i, H72i(T). The index value is the single site sample average, $\mu$H72i. For each site, the values of H72i scaled, i.e. divided, by $\mu$H72i, H72i* are calculated. These are dimensionless quantiles with given return period. Some standard statistical tests are carried out, showing that the distribution of H72i* is homogeneous in space, i.e. it is similar for each site in the considered area, which can then be viewed as a homogeneous region. Therefore, it is possible to use a regional approach for the frequency estimation of H72*. The values of H72i* are then grouped together in only one sample and their frequency of occurrence is accommodated by a general extreme value, GEV, probability distribution. The proposed distribution, valid in each site of the study area, can be used to assess the T-years return period quantiles of H72i*. Then, by multiplying H72i* by the single site sample index value $\mu$H72i, an estimate of the T-years quantile of H72i at the single site is obtained. A sampling strategy is also suggested to estimate the single site index value, i.e. the average $\mu$H72i, critical for the evaluation of the single site distribution of H72i. The final result is an estimate of the 3-day snow fall depth with a given return period, H72i(T) for each site. Also, the standard error of estimation of H72i(T) is given. It is shown that the value of H72i(T) estimated by the regional approach is far more reliable than that calculated by the distribution fitting carried out using the data at each single site, particularly for high return periods. The values of H72i(T) can be used as inputs to dynamic models, for avalanche hazard mapping exercise. The sensitivity analysis of the avalanche hazard maps to the uncertainty in the estimation of H72i(T) can be also carried out, using the reference methods available in the present literature.},

The ground snow load is recommended in Chinese load code for the design of building structures in the applicable jurisdiction; this load needs to be updated regularly by integrating new available snow measurements and new analysis techniques. This study is concentrated on the estimation of extreme snow depth and ground snow load and on snow hazard mapping in China by using historical snow measurement data. A probabilistic model of the snowpack bulk density was developed. For the extreme value analysis of annual maximum snow depth, both the at-site analysis and region of influence approach were applied. Also, several commonly used probabilistic models and distribution fitting methods were considered for the extreme value analysis. For the annual maximum snow depth, it was identified from the at-site analysis results that the number of sites where the lognormal distribution is preferred is greater than that where the Gumbel distribution is preferred. The 50-year return period value obtained from the ROI approach is insensitive to whether the three-parameter lognormal distribution or the generalized extreme value distribution is adopted. Maps of annual maximum snow depth and ground snow load were developed. Comparison of the estimated ground snow load to that recommended in the design code was presented, and potential updating to the ground snow load in the design code was suggested.},

The model is driven with gridded meteorological input data of the integrated nowcasting model INCA (8.1 – 17.7°E; 45.8 - 49.5°N) that uses remote sensing and radar data as well as ground observations and is operated by the Austrian weather service ZAMG. Additional data from remote sensing and ground measurements are used to validate and calibrate the model output consisting mainly of snow height and snow water equivalent maps in a spatial resolution of 100 m and a time resolution of 15 minutes in near real-time. Its energy balance mode contains partly newly developed schemes (e.g. radiation, cloudiness) based on high quality solar and terrestrial radiation data, satellite products and ground measurements. Snow physical properties and snow cover dynamics are currently incorporated in the model based on a simple 2-layer scheme, as the primary focus of the model are fast calculations on the large grid and to accurately represent the spatial distribution of the snow mass and depth (and not its detailed microstructural behavior), which is of great interest for authorities and the general public. Snow extent from SNOWGRID together with satellite data is also used to evaluate the effect of initializing a numerical weather prediction model such as AROME using a real snow distribution instead of climatological estimates as it is operationally done. As the model is still in development, the results and methods shown here are preliminary and not complete yet.},

abstract = {We present properties of a dependence measure that arises in the study of extreme values in multivariate and spatial problems. For multivariate problems the dependence measure characterises dependence at the bivariate level, for all pairs and all higher orders up to and including the dimension of the variable. Necessary and sufficient conditions are given for subsets of dependence measures to be self‐consistent, that is to guarantee the existence of a distribution with such a subset of values for the dependence measure. For pairwise dependence, these conditions are given in terms of positive semidefinite matrices and non‐differentiable, positive definite functions. We construct new nonparametric estimators for the dependence measure which, unlike all naive nonparametric estimators, impose these self‐consistency properties. As the new estimators provide an improvement on the naive methods, both in terms of the inferential and interpretability properties, their use in exploratory extreme value analyses should aid the identification of appropriate dependence models. The methods are illustrated through an analysis of simulated multivariate data, which shows that a lack of self‐consistency is frequently a problem with the existing estimators, and by a spatial analysis of daily rainfall extremes in south‐west England, which finds a smooth decay in extremal dependence with distance.},

It is hoped, in particular, that it will appeal to practitioners of extreme value modeling with limited statistical expertise. The mathematical level is elementary, and detailed mathematical proof is usually sacrificed in favor of heuristic argument. Rather more attention is paid to statistical detail, and many examples are provided by way of illustration. All the computations were carried out using the S-PLUS statistical software program, and corresponding datasets and functions are available via the internet, as explained in the Appendix. "We describe a wide variety of examples of extreme value problems and datasets in Chapter 1. These are drawn from different fields—oceanography, wind engineering and finance, amongst others—and are used to illustrate the various modeling procedures in subsequent chapters. Chapter 2 gives a brief introduction to general techniques of statistical modeling. This chapter could be skipped by readers with reasonable statistical knowledge. "The heart of the book is contained in Chapters 3 to 8. These chapters include the classical block maxima models for extremes, threshold exceedance models, extensions to stationary and non-stationary sequences, a point process modeling framework and multivariate extreme value models. Chapter 9 provides a brief introduction to a number of more advanced topics, including Bayesian inference and spatial extremes.”},

First, ‘standard' methods are reviewed: annual maxima, independent storms, r-largest extremes with the GEV distribution, and peak-over-threshold extremes with the GPD. Techniques for calculating the distribution parameters and quantiles are described. There follows a discussion of the factors which must be considered in order to fulfil the criterion that the data should be independent and identically distributed, and in order to minimize standard errors. It is commonplace in studies of extreme wind speeds that the time series available for analysis are very short. Finally, therefore, the paper deals with techniques applicable to data sets as short as two years, including simulation modelling and methods based on the parameters of the parent distribution.},

abstract = {Our objective is to study the dependence structure of extreme snowfall in the French Alps. Snowfall amount measurements (3 days accumulation period) from 90 monitoring stations providing data spanning from 1958 to 2013 were projected at the same altitude level (1800m). Annual maxima of projected snowfall were modeled with Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distributions and transformed in unit Fr{\'{e}}chet in order to focus on the dependence structure only. The final goal is to evaluate the spatio-temporal evolution of this dependence structure and to compare the ability of different max-stable models to capture it. In addition to the most classical max-stable models (Smith and Schlather), max-stable processes made available more recently (extremal-t, Geometric Gaussian and Brown-Resnick) were also considered, taking into account spatial anisotropy. These latter models are found to be the most suitable in our case according to CLIC. Further cross-validation on joint exceedance probabilities does not clearly discriminate these max-stable models. Results show that measurement stations in the Northern and Central Alps are strongly dependent whereas stations from the extreme Southern Alps, influenced by Mediterranean effects, are more isolated. Furthermore, extremal dependence appears controlled by the orientation of mountains and valleys. Finally, using an estimation window moving in time, we highlight a recent decrease in extremal dependence at large distances.},

abstract = {Whereas changes in magnitude of geophysical extremes under climate change have received significant attention, potential concomitant changes in spatial dependence structures have remained unexplored so far. Here we provide first evidence of such an effect, highlighting a significant trend in the spatial dependence structure of snowfall extremes in the French Alps at decadal time scale. Specifically, we process a comprehensive data set of winter maximum snowfall from all over the French Alps collected in 90 stations from 1958 to 2012. We estimate extremal dependence over 20 year moving estimation windows taking into account possible anisotropy potentially related to orographic effects and/or patterns in atmospheric flows. For each window, we derive a range representing the distance above which extremes are almost independent. We show that snowfall extremes tended to become less spatially dependent over time, with the dependence range reduced roughly by half during the study period. We demonstrate the connection between this trend and local and synoptic climatic variables associated with the current climate change context. In details, the decreasing pattern in extremal dependence is concomitant with a trend toward less harsh winter conditions. It is attributable at first to the increase in temperature and its major control on the snow/rain partitioning. Yet a magnitude effect, with less dependent extremes due to a decrease in intensity of precipitation, also exists. Finally, we show that our results are largely insensitive to the minimal modeling assumptions necessary to our data-based approach. This robustness makes it potentially suitable for various other studies in the field of geophysical extremes.},

The procedure is sufficiently reliable and versatile to permit the simultaneous modeling of marginal and dependence parameters in the spatial context at a moderate computational cost. The utility of this methodology is examined via simulation, and illustrated by the analysis of U.S. precipitation extremes.},
